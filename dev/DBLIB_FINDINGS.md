# DbLib schematic placement - API findings

Established with the sandbox harness (`dev/sandbox_runner.py`) against a
production DbLib. "Verified" means it actually ran and produced the stated
result; failures are recorded so they are not retried blindly.

## Reading the library

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `IntegratedLibraryManager` | non-nil (verified) |
| `.AvailableLibraryCount` / `.AvailableLibraryPath(i)` | enumerates installed libraries (verified) |
| `.AvailableLibraryType(i)` | **3 = DbLib**, 0 = IntLib - the discriminator |
| `.GetAvailableDBLibDocAtPath(path)` | returns `IDatabaseLibDocument`, works over a UNC/network share |
| `IDatabaseLibDocument.GetTableCount` / `.GetTableNameAt(i)` | enumerated all 30 tables |

## Reading part data (no Altium needed)

A `.DbLib` file is an INI: `ConnectionString` points at the backing database
(here Access/ACE OLEDB). Enabled `*_Query` tables carry
`UserWhereText=[Corp_Part_Number] = '{Corp_Part_Number}'`, i.e. they are
parameterised lookups keyed by the corporate part number. Useful columns:
`Corp_Part_Number`, `Symbol_Name`, `Footprint_Name`, `Description`.

Read-only queries via OLEDB (PowerShell `System.Data.OleDb` or Python) return
part rows directly - the fastest way to resolve a part number to its symbol
and footprint names without driving Altium.

## Placement: what does NOT work

- `IntegratedLibraryManager.PlaceLibraryComponent(libRef, libPath, params)`
  returns without error but **places nothing**. Verified for both the DbLib
  and a plain `.SchLib`, with the target document confirmed current, and with
  a follow-up run confirming it is not merely deferred. Not DbLib-specific.
- Process `Sch:PlaceIntegratedComponentFromDB` with the documented parameters
  (`LibReference`, `Library`, `SourceLibraryName`, `DatabaseTableName`,
  `CurFootprint`, `PartId`, `Location.X/Y`) runs without error and places
  nothing.
- `ISch_Component.DatabaseLibraryName` / `.DatabaseTableName` are **not
  writable** - assigning to them kills the script (and wedges the executor).
  `.DesignItemID` *is* writable.

## Placement: what DOES work (verified)

Replicate the symbol out of its source `.SchLib` and register it:

1. `Client.OpenDocument('SchLib', <symbol library path>)` + `Client.ShowDocument`
2. `SchServer.GetCurrentSchDocument` -> iterate `SchLibIterator_Create` with
   `MkSet(eSchComponent)` to find the component whose `LibReference` matches
   the DB's `Symbol_Name`
3. `Component.Replicate` (returns a detached copy)
4. `GetWorkSpace.DM_CreateNewDocument('SCH')` for a target sheet (also focuses
   it); `SchServer.GetCurrentSchDocument` then returns it
5. On the replica set `Designator.Text`, `Location` (`Point(MilsToCoord..)`),
   and `DesignItemID`
6. `TargetDoc.RegisterSchObjectInContainer(replica)` then
   `SchServer.RobotManager.SendMessage(TargetDoc.I_ObjectAddress, c_BroadCast,
   SCHM_PrimitiveRegistration, replica.I_ObjectAddress)`
7. `TargetDoc.GraphicallyInvalidate`

Result: component count went 0 -> 1, reported as `RES-DISCRETE/R900`, drawn
with its graphics.

**Important correction:** this alone produces an *unlinked shell*. The symbol
carries its library placeholder parameter values (`TOLERANCE=TOL`,
`PKG_STYLE=PKG_STL`, `VALUE=VALUE`) - none of the database values are pulled
in, because this path bypasses Altium's DbLib machinery entirely. Populating
them is a separate step (below).

Symbol location: the DbLib's `LibrarySearchPath` lists the symbol folders;
the `.SchLib` containing a given `Symbol_Name` can be found by scanning those
files (component names appear as plain and UTF-16 text inside the binaries).

## How the DbLib mapping is actually defined

The `.DbLib` has no `Symbol`/`Footprint`/`Param` keys; the mapping lives in 81
`Options=` lines, one per mapped field, e.g.

```
Options=FieldName=RESISTORS_Query.Altium_Footprint|TableNameOnly=RESISTORS_Query|
        FieldNameOnly=Altium_Footprint|FieldType=1|ParameterName=[Footprint Ref]|...
```

Only *system* fields are mapped explicitly (bracketed parameter names):
`Description -> [Description]`, `Altium_Symbol -> [Library Ref]`,
`Altium_Footprint -> [Footprint Ref]`, `Altium_3DModel -> [PCB3D Ref]`, plus
`Corp_Part_Number` as a normal parameter. Everything else is matched
**implicitly by name**: a symbol parameter is filled from the database column
of the same name, case-insensitively.

Worked example (`RES-DISCRETE`, part `1102-0001`, table `RESISTORS_Query`):

| symbol parameter | placeholder | DB column | DB value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VALUE` | `VALUE` | `Value` | `200` |
| `TOLERANCE` | `TOL` | `Tolerance` | `1%` |
| `PKG_STYLE` | `PKG_STL` | `Pkg_Style` | `0201` |
| `PWR_RATING` | `PWR` | `Pwr_Rating` | `1/20W` |
| `Comment` | (empty) | `Description` | `RES, 0201, 1%, 1/20W, 200` |

Note the enabled table is the `*_Query` view, not the base table, and the two
disagree: `RESISTORS.Footprint_Name = R0201A` but
`RESISTORS_Query.Altium_Footprint = RESC0603X03N`. The `*_Query` view is what
Altium uses, so it is authoritative.

## Parameter population (verified)

Iterate the replicated component's `eParameter` children and assign
`.Text` from the matching database column before registering it. Values read
back from the objects afterwards confirmed real data
(`PWR_RATING=1/20W`, `VALUE=200`, `TOLERANCE=1%`, `PKG_STYLE=0201`), and the
component `Comment` was set from the DB `Description`.

## Full component construction (verified)

Matching what Altium's own DbLib placement produces requires three things
beyond replicating the symbol. Read back off the placed component:

1. **Fill existing placeholder parameters** - iterate `eParameter` children and
   assign `.Text` from the same-named database column.
2. **Add the database columns the symbol does not carry** - for each remaining
   non-null column, `SchServer.SchObjectFactory(eParameter, eCreate_Default)`,
   set `Name`/`Text`/`ParamType`/`ReadOnlyState`/`IsHidden`, then
   `Component.AddSchObject(param)` plus a `SCHM_PrimitiveRegistration` robot
   message. Reference placements show these as hidden, database-sourced
   parameters.
3. **Attach the footprint model** - `Component.AddSchImplementation`, then
   `ClearAllDatafileLinks`, `ModelName` (from `Altium_Footprint`),
   `ModelType := 'PCBLIB'`, `IsCurrent := True`,
   `UseComponentLibrary := True`.

Verified result on the placed part: 17 parameters (5 symbol + 11 database +
Comment) and 1 `PCBLIB` model `RESC0603X03N` marked current, with
`LibReference=RES-DISCRETE`, `DesignItemID=1102-0001`, and Comment from the
database Description.

Ordering note: register the component on the sheet *before* adding parameters
and the model.

## What a genuine GUI/database-placed component stores

Read off a production part (C17) placed through Altium's own DbLib flow:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `LibReference` | `CAP-NP` |
| `DesignItemID` | `2104-0017` (the corporate part number) |
| `DatabaseTableName` | `CAPACITORS_Query` (the *_Query view) |
| `DatabaseLibraryName` | `Neoventus_Components.DbLib` (**file name only**, no path) |
| `SourceLibraryName` | `Neoventus_Components.DbLib` |
| `LibraryPath` | `*` |
| `Comment` | `CAP-NP` (the **LibReference**, not the description) |
| parameters | 18, all `hidden=True`, `readonly=0`, `paramtype=0` |
| model | one `PCBLIB`, `IsCurrent=True`, `UseComponentLibrary=True`, **1 datafile link** |

Two corrections to earlier work this implies: `Comment` should be the
LibReference (not the DB description), and the model needs a datafile link.
The per-parameter flags carry no special "database" marker - the linkage lives
on the component (`DatabaseTableName`/`DatabaseLibraryName`).

## Update from Database works on constructed parts (user-verified)

Running Altium's **Update from Database** on a scripted component populated it
correctly. So Altium matches the part by `DesignItemID` (which *is* writable)
and does not require the script to stamp `DatabaseLibraryName`/
`DatabaseTableName` itself.

This changes the architecture substantially - and removes the need for
per-table column knowledge:

1. place the symbol (replicate from the source `.SchLib`)
2. set `Designator`, `DesignItemID` (the corporate part number), `Comment`
3. let Altium's Update from Database fill every parameter and model natively

Nothing about the placement needs to be table-specific, because Altium does the
mapping. Remaining task: identify the process name so the tool can trigger the
update programmatically instead of relying on the user running the menu item.

## Known bug: parameter text left behind when positioning

Symptom (observed after Update from Database): the component body moves to the
requested location but its parameter/designator text stays where the part
originally sat.

Cause: assigning `Component.Location` moves the component origin and its
graphical primitives, but child text objects (`Designator`, each
`ISch_Parameter`) carry their own absolute coordinates and are left behind at
the library symbol's coordinates.

Fix: do not assign `Location` on a replica. Register the component, then use
`Component.MoveByXY(dx, dy)`, which translates the component together with its
children. (Alternatively, offset every child's `Location` by the same delta.)
This also explains why the earlier test parts appeared at the sheet corner.

## Historical note: the read-only linkage fields

`DatabaseLibraryName` and `DatabaseTableName` are **read-only** - assigning
them kills the script both before *and* after registration (verified
separately). This was originally thought to be a blocker, but it is not: write
access is unnecessary because Update from Database resolves the part from
`DesignItemID` (see above). Do not attempt to set these fields.

Native placement APIs that would do this correctly are no-ops in the scripting
context, retried with the exact identity values above (file-name-only library,
`*_Query` table): both `Sch:PlaceIntegratedComponentFromDB` and
`IntegratedLibraryManager.PlaceLibraryComponent` return without error and place
nothing.

## Path to GUI-identical placement

Since Update from Database works on constructed parts, the plan is: replicate
the symbol, set the identity fields, position with `MoveByXY`, then trigger the
update. If a replica of an **already database-linked donor** component also
carries the linkage fields (they are copied, not assigned), that would make the
part fully indistinguishable from a GUI placement - worth testing next.

Fallback if the update cannot be triggered programmatically: drive the GUI via
UI automation, which is authentic by construction but fragile.

## Verification against real database-placed parts

`dev/verify_placement.py` places a part with the same part number as an existing
GUI/database-placed component and diffs **every** parameter, the model, symbol
and comment. Six parts were tested, one per enabled table (capacitor, resistor,
ferrite, IC, fuse, connector).

Results:

| part | table | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| J900 | CONNECTORS_Query | **exact match** |
| R921 | RESISTORS_Query | **exact match** (after the PKG_TYPE fix) |
| C900, F900, FB900, R920 | various | one extra `PKG_TYPE` parameter (placed before the fix) |
| U900 | INTEGRATED_CIRCUITS_Query | `Comment` differs (see below) |

Two real findings came out of it:

1. **Defect found and fixed - `PKG_TYPE` must be excluded.** The `.DbLib` maps
   it (and the `DxDesigner_*` columns) to an **empty** `ParameterName`, which is
   how it says "do not create a parameter". Exclusions are now derived from the
   `.DbLib` itself rather than hardcoded, so this generalises to any table.
   R921, placed after the fix, matches its reference exactly.

2. **Some reference components are stale, not wrong.** Where values differed,
   the verifier now queries the current database: e.g. reference
   `Mfgr1_Part_Number='ERJ-2RKF1002'` vs placed `'ERJ-2RKF1002-'`, and reference
   `Status_Database=2` vs placed `3` - in both cases the placed value matches
   the database *today*, and the reference component is a snapshot from when it
   was last updated. These are reported separately from real defects.

### Known remaining difference: Comment

For the IC the reference has an empty `Comment`, while the pipeline sets it to
the LibReference; for the passives and the connector the references *do* carry
the LibReference, so the current default matches 3 of 4. No table maps anything
to a Comment parameter, so this is not database-driven - the IC's empty comment
was most likely cleared by hand. The spec's `COMMENT|` record is optional:
omit it to leave whatever the symbol defines.

## Techniques from the existing BatchUpdateFromLibraries script

Stephen's own `BatchUpdateFromLibraries` script (Macros\Altium\Altium-ScriptsDbLib\) swaps `DesignItemID` for parts listed in a CSV, then **selects** them so
the user can finish with `Right click > Part Actions > Update Selected From
Libraries`. It confirms the architecture used here (set `DesignItemID`, let
Altium update from the library/database) and it does **not** trigger the update
programmatically - so no process name for that is known from this source
either.

Three techniques worth adopting:

1. `SchServer.GetSchDocumentByPath(Doc.DM_FullPath)` - the correct way to target
   a specific schematic instead of relying on whichever document is current.
   This is what the MCP tool should use rather than scratch sheets.
2. `SchServer.ProcessControl.PreProcess(doc, '')` / `PostProcess(doc, '')`
   around modifications, giving proper undo support.
3. `Component.Selection := True` on placed parts, so the user can run
   "Update Selected From Libraries" in one gesture immediately afterwards.

On `Comment`: Stephen reports the symbol database generally leaves it empty,
yet placed parts show the symbol name in the schematic - consistent with the
current default (Comment = LibReference) and with 3 of the 4 references
checked. The IC's empty comment looks like the outlier.

## Found: the update processes DO exist (enumerated from Altium)

The API references do not document them, but Altium's own process registry
does. `IClient` exposes the full catalog:

```pascal
for i := 0 to Client.GetServerRecordCount - 1 do
begin
    Rec := Client.GetServerRecord(i);          // IServerRecord
    for j := 0 to Rec.GetCommandCount - 1 do
    begin
        Cmd := Rec.GetCommand(j);              // IServerProcess
        // Rec.GetName + ':' + Cmd.GetOriginalId, Cmd.GetLongSummary,
        // Cmd.GetParameterCount / GetParameter(k)
    end;
end;
```

Dumping it yields **1029 processes across 86 modules** (saved as
`dev/altium_process_catalog.txt`). The relevant ones:

| process | summary | params |
|---|---|---|
| `Sch:UpdatePartDatabaseLinks` | Update all schematic parts database links | 0 |
| `Sch:UpdatePartsFromLibraryList` | Update all parts from listed libraries | 0 |
| `Sch:UpdateComponentsFromLibraryEditor` | Update components in all opened schematic documents | 0 |
| `Sch:UpdatePartFromLibraryEditor` | Update part from library editor | 0 |

All take **no parameters**, so they act on the focused document/selection.

**Both plausible candidates were tested and neither works.** With a bare
identity-only part placed and selected on the focused schematic:

| process | result |
|---|---|
| `Sch:UpdatePartDatabaseLinks` | ran cleanly, changed nothing (6 params before and after, no model, `DatabaseTableName` still empty) |
| `Sch:UpdatePartsFromLibraryList` | same - no change, and no wizard dialog appeared |

A stronger second test removed the obvious objection to the first. The initial
test used a bare identity-only part, so "nothing to update" was a plausible
explanation. It was repeated on a **real, database-linked production part**
(`DatabaseTableName = INTEGRATED_CIRCUITS_Query`) whose parameters had been
deliberately edited to `TEST1`..`TEST9` and `TEST-COMMENT`, selected in the
focused schematic - exactly the situation where the GUI action restores
database values. Both processes ran and **left every parameter unchanged**.

So the process registry contains no working programmatic equivalent of
"Update From Libraries / Database"; the GUI action evidently runs through the
ECO engine rather than a directly invokable process.

**This does not block the workflow**, because the construction pipeline already
produces parts that match GUI-placed references field-by-field without needing
an update. The update remains relevant only for establishing true database
*linkage* (`DatabaseTableName`), which stays unreachable from script.

This enumeration technique is generally useful: any undocumented Altium
command can be found this way rather than guessed.

## Still open

- **Verify `Sch:UpdatePartDatabaseLinks`** actually populates a placed part
  (process found by enumeration, takes no parameters, but the confirming test
  has not run yet). If it works, placement becomes: replicate symbol, set
  identity, select, run the process - and Altium does the rest natively.
- Deriving parameters dynamically per table instead of hardcoding columns:
  query the part's `*_Query` view and use its non-null columns, so every
  category works without table-specific code. (Only relevant if construction
  remains the approach; path 1 above makes Altium do it.)
- Placing onto an existing project sheet rather than a scratch document, and
  confirming placement coordinates (the test part landed at the sheet corner).


## Only .DbLib is supported

This tooling supports **.DbLib only**. The other Altium database library types
are NOT implemented and should not be assumed to work:

| Type | Why it is not supported |
|---|---|
| **.SVNDbLib** | Same INI + ConnectionString shape, models versioned in Subversion. Probably a small change, but untested - no SVNDbLib was available. |
| **.DbLink** | Different feature entirely: syncs parameters onto components that are ALREADY placed. It cannot be a placement source. |
| **Altium 365 / Workspace** | Managed Items with revisions and no ConnectionString. Needs a different API altogether. |

Note also that the SQL issued here uses T-SQL dialect (`SELECT TOP n`,
`[bracket]` quoting). A .DbLib ConnectionString can point at any OLEDB source,
so a MySQL or PostgreSQL backend would need those statements rephrased
(`LIMIT`, different quoting) even though the connection itself would work.

**Building any of this out needs someone familiar with the database type in
question.** It cannot be written blind and verified against a .DbLib - the
whole point of the failures recorded above is that plausible-looking untested
code is worse than none.
